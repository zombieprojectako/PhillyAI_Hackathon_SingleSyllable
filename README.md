# Philadelphia Health Hackaton

## Using Maching Learning to predict upcoming ovulation cycles for female patients.

## The Presenting Problems:

Fertility preservation is a key issue for two sets of women

1) Women facing cancer who wish to have fertility preservation for when they recover have a very limited time in which to pursue fertility treatment.

2) Women who must delay childbirth due to economic motivations or other family reasons, often must turn to fertility treatment to start a family.

## Why We are Doing This.

The purpose of our project was to use modern machine learning tools to improve estimation of the between menstral periods of woman.  By performing better estimates, we can lower treatment costs for infertility.  

## Why this Matters.

Infertility is a trying issue for many families accross America.  Infertility treatment is both expensive and risky.  Typically there is narrow window during which infertility treaments are effective.  By effectively estimating when a woman's ovulation cycle begins, treatment can be focused during the best time of the month. This increases the probability of sucess in treatment and lowers attendant costs.

## Repo Organization
- code --> holds all jupyter notebook files
- data_in --> all raw data used in process
- data_out --> all output/clean data
- deck --> location of project deck
- graphics --> graph/image files
- R --> all R code and resources used in this project

## Requirements/Install
We are new to this and using multiple tech stacks, so we aplogize for any install issues.  Everything runs and has been tested.

Requirements:
- python 3 (see requirements.txt file for libraries)
- r
- conda (preferred over pip)

To Run:
- clone github repository (https://github.com/zombieprojectako/PhillyAI_Hackathon_SingleSyllable)
- use conda to install required python libraries from the requirements.txt file
- run jupyter notebooks to see data cleaning process
- run R scripts to test final model solution
