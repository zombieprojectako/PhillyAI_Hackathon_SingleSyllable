# PhillyAI_Hackathon_SingleSyllable

## Using AI we are looking to predict upcoming periods for female users to help predict fertility windows.

## Use case:
Fertility preservation is a key issue for two sets of women
1) Women facing cancer who wish to have fertility preservation for when they recover
2) Women who wish to delay childbearing to pursue other interests
